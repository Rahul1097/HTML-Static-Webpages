        <h3>The single biggest reason why start-ups succeed | Bill Gross</h3>
        <p>Bill Gross has founded a lot of start-ups, and incubated many others — and he got curious about why some
            succeeded and others failed. So he gathered data from hundreds of companies, his own and other people's, and
            ranked each company on five key factors. He found one factor that stands out from the others — and surprised
            even him.
